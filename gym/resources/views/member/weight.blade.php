<h4>The Best Free-Weights Workout Plan To Build Strength</h4>
	<h5>This workout plan helps you master a trio of movement patterns to build functional strength and muscle size</h5>

	<div class="p-4"><img src="{{asset('img/a1.jpg')}}" height="400px" width="800px;"></div>

	<p>It’s not essential to use free weights in your training to bulk up and burn fat, but if you use them in the right way, it’s fair to say dumbbells, kettlebells and the barbell can make building muscle easier. However, it does have to be in the right way. It’s easy to overestimate your abilities when selecting the weight for your workouts – and it’s always better to get the form right with a lighter weight, or even no weight at all, than get pulled out of shape straining to lift a weight you’re not ready for.</p>

	<p>The training plan below is a great way to get to grips with free weights. You’ll work with a barbell as well as dumbbells and kettlebells to challenge muscles all over your body, using foundational compound exercises like squats, lunges and deadlifts, as well as targeting specific muscle groups with isolated moves like biceps curls.</p>

	<p>Over the four weeks of the plan you’ll focus on movement patterns, rather than hitting certain muscle groups with your workouts. The first training session is built around pushing exercises, working the chest, quads, shoulders and triceps. Then in the second workout, you’ll do pulling moves, hitting your back, hamstrings and biceps. In the final workout, all the exercises involve rotating your body or resisting rotation.</p>

	<p>By training in this way you’ll build all-over functional strength, becoming stronger and leaner in a way that brings benefits to everyday life and when playing sports, as well as improving your performance in the gym.</p>

    <h2>How To Do These Workouts</h2>
    <p> the sets, reps and rest instructions for each move to get the maximum benefit. Do each workout once a week for four weeks, aiming to increase the amount you lift each week – and make sure you note how much you lift in each session to track your progress and keep yourself motivated.</p>

    <h2>How To Warm Up For These Workouts</h2>
    <p>When you’re working with heavy free weights it’s vital to warm up before you start your session. Not only will you reduce your risk of injury, but you’ll also ensure you’re ready to excel from your first rep onwards, rather than struggling with your first few sets while your body gets accustomed to the idea you’re working out.</p>

        <p>A warm-up doesn’t have to take more than five to ten minutes, but it does have to be linked to the workout you’re about to do, so don’t just jump on the treadmill and then assume you’re ready to lift heavy weights.</p>
        
        <p>Start with this dynamic stretching routine to get your muscles moving, and then move on to some workout-specific exercises. With the workouts below, the simplest way to do this is to run through a round of the exercises you’re going to do, using very light weights or no weights at all. That way you’ll know for sure you’re working the exact muscles you’re about to test.</p>
        
        <p>When it comes to preparing for bodyweight exercises like diamond press-ups, you can do a shortened set during your warm-up round or opt for an easier variation like press-ups with your knees grounded. Remember you’re just aiming to get the muscles firing, not exhaust yourself before the workout proper begins.</p>

    <h1>Workout 1: Push</h1></div>

<div>
<h2>1> Dumbbell bench press</h2>

<div class="pt-4"><img src="{{asset('img/a2.jpg')}}" height="400px" width="800px;"></div>
<p class="pb-2"><b>Sets</b> 3 <b>Reps</b> 10 <b>Rest</b> 60sec</p>

<p></p><b>Why</b> The week kicks off with a double header of everyone’s favourite move – the bench press. You start with the dumbbell version because you’ll go a bit lighter than with a barbell, and it’s better for warming up your shoulders because you have to work harder to stabilise the joint.</p>

<p></p><b>How</b> Lie on a bench with your feet on the floor directly underneath your knees, holding the dumbbells above your chest. Lower them to your chest, then drive your feet hard into the floor and push the dumbbells back strongly to the start position.</p>
</div>


<div>
    <h2>2> Incline bench press</h2>

    <div class="pt-4"><img src="{{asset('img/a3.jpg')}}" height="400px" width="800px;"></div>

<p>Why The incline version of the move puts a slightly different emphasis on your muscles, working the front shoulders a bit more than the flat version does. You’ll probably find you can’t lift quite as much weight because of this.</p>

<p>How Lie on a bench set at a 45˚ incline, holding a bar over your chest with your hands just wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower the bar until it’s touching your chest, then press it back up.</p>
